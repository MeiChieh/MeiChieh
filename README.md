# Project Portfolio

### üëã Hello, I‚Äôm Mei, nice to meet you !

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm a data scientist with a background in __biology__ and a passion for solving complex problems with data. My path started in academic research, where I developed a human gene interaction database using BioPython to help researchers access critical information. This experience led me to __frontend development__ at Jimdo's Growth Team, where I built __data-driven A/B testing tools__ that increased conversion rates by 25% and discovered my love for extracting actionable insights from data. Now as a __full-fledged data scientist__, I uncover patterns, develop predictive models, and transform raw information into impactful solutions that drive decision-making.

__üß™ How I Think__
I thrive where data meets decisions. I approach problems methodically - from framing the right questions and preparing clean datasets to implementing appropriate models and measuring real-world impact. Whether it's engineering predictive features for credit risk assessment or building NLP pipelines for text classification, I focus on creating solutions that deliver tangible value and drive evidence-based decision making.

__üîé Current Focus__
I‚Äôm diving deeper into applied __machine learning__, __deep learning__ and __model evaluation__. I‚Äôve been building multi-label classifiers, experimenting with imbalance techniques, and fine-tuning large language models. I love pushing my limits and making things that are both smart and useful.

__üå± Still Growing__
I'm constantly learning‚Äîwhether it's exploring __AI agent__ architectures, fine-tuning large language models with __LoRA__, or learning __MLOps__ for seamless deployment. I'm also working on my __Dutch__ (currently approaching A2 fluency) while living in Belgium. I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge, which is why I enjoy mentoring data science learners and leading interactive classroom sessions in my learning program.

__ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect__
If you‚Äôre into turning raw data into business insights, building predictive model for forecasting, or interesting AI product ideas, let's connect and have a chat !
